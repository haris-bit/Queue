# Queue
## Implemented a queue data structure in Java by creating a Queue class that:
## - Follows FIFO protocol with .enqueue() and .dequeue() methods
## - Gives you the option to create bounded queues with the maxSize property
## - Prevents queue underflow and overflow by keeping track of queue size

## I also created a program in Script.java that uses the methods and variables of the RestaurantOrders.java file to assign restaurant food orders to either a Head Chef, Sous Chef, or a waiting list.
